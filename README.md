# Restaurant Community Coupon
I have always had an idea to bring the NFT space to the restaurant industry. This particular dapp was able to bring some of it to life. Restaurants are the most active industry in the world and have the most vibrant community and coupons which have become digital has become an ever rapid space. Bringing  the NFT to the coupon space makes a coupon a collectible and the rarity of each coupon determines how valuable it should be. In this dapp, restaurants can add their coupon to the community and have the users claim them and use them in their restaurants which I think is dope. This dapp was built using the celo blockchain.
